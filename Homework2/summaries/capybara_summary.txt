- The capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) is the largest rodent in the world, native to South America.
- Known for its social behavior, capybaras often live in groups of 10-20, sometimes up to 100.
- They are semi-aquatic, inhabiting areas near rivers, lakes, and marshes, and are excellent swimmers.
- Capybaras primarily graze on grasses and aquatic plants, and practice coprophagy to aid their digestion.
- They are not considered endangered, but face threats from hunting and habitat destruction; they have also adapted well to urban environments.
