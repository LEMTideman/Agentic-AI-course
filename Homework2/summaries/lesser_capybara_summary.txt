- The **lesser capybara** (_Hydrochoerus isthmius_) is a semi-aquatic rodent found primarily in South America, classified as its own species since the 1980s.
- It inhabits areas near water bodies such as marshes and lagoons, essential for thermoregulation, food, and protection from predators.
- Lesser capybaras are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and aquatic plants, but adapt their diet based on seasonal food availability.
- They are smaller than common capybaras, weighing up to 62 pounds and reaching about 3 feet in length, with adaptations for swimming and diving to evade predators.
- Breeding occurs year-round in water, with births averaging 3 to 4 pups after a gestation period of about 108 days.
