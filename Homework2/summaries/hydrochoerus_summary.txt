- The genus Hydrochoerus includes the largest living rodents, known as capybaras, which are semiaquatic and found near bodies of water in South America.
- Capybaras can weigh up to 65 kg (143 lb) and have a gestation period of 130-150 days, typically giving birth to 2-8 young.
- They are highly social animals, living in groups of up to 100 and communicating through various vocalizations.
- The genus includes two living species: Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris (capybara) and Hydrochoerus isthmius (lesser capybara), along with three extinct species.
- Hydrochoerus evolved from relatives within the Caviidae family, diverging from the rock cavies about 12 million years ago in the late Middle Miocene.
